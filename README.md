# TO-DO--LIST-APPLICATION-PROJECTS
A simple To-Do List app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It uses localStorage for front-end persistence and a PHP backend to store tasks. A great project for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic PHP integration.
